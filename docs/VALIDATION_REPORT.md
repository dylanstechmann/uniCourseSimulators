# Validation report

## Scope and result

2026-10-05; synthetic local learner data only. Milestones 1 and 2 are implemented. Milestone 3 is in progress; current numeric-grader increments add exact, constrained SI/biological unit conversion, dimension checks, bounded relative tolerance, and optional lexical significant-figure checks alongside multiple-select partial credit and grading-specification digests. All 25 preserved course packages are **partial**; zero are beta, complete or externally reviewed. No instructor review, semester equivalence, university credit, security certification or public production deployment is asserted.

All suites passed in the latest integrated M3 increment: **182 tests** (37 content/security, 125 backend, 13 frontend, 4 legacy, 3 browser). Offline content validation passed with 125 disclosed depth/coverage warnings. Live-link validation is **not fully passed**: two JHU pages returned HTTP 403.

## Milestone 3 incremental validation

The implementation now includes multiple-select partial credit, version-pinned question digests, explicit package-version updates, and numeric grader v5. The numeric implementation parses a bounded, documented subset of SI and biological units into exact rational scales and seven base dimensions, converts learner values into the authored unit, combines absolute and bounded relative tolerance against the authored answer, checks optional author-provided dimensions, and enforces optional 1–12 significant-figure requirements after the value passes tolerance. Decimal precision is counted from the learner's notation; the reader exposes the required precision as accessible question metadata and explanatory helper text. Contextual `pH`, `units`, and `mol ATP` labels are exact-label-only and cannot be composed; unknown and affine units fail closed. Numeric input length, decimal magnitudes, unit expression length, token count, exponents, relative tolerance, and significant-figure policy values are bounded. The digest is omitted from learner DTOs because it fingerprints answer-bearing content. Public lesson DTOs expose the required precision but never answer keys. Historical attempts remain unchanged with their recorded grader version and null digest where previously absent.

The migration test confirms preexisting attempts survive with no invented specification digest. Numeric grader tests recalculate conversion and absolute/relative-tolerance boundaries for rates, compound concentration/time units, lengths, acceleration, percentages and derived units; they also check significant-figure counts across decimal/exponent notation and integer trailing zeros, a 12-figure upper bound, invalid policies, negative/zero answers, dimensions, exact-label contextual units, unknown/affine units, malformed/incompatible units, alternate micro symbols, exponent bounds, and SI case distinctions. The deployed-content integration check grades all 101 published practice specifications and verifies learner DTOs omit solution data. An API test confirms precision metadata is public while answer specifications remain private, and that an in-tolerance answer with excess precision receives a specific diagnostic. A version-upgrade API test verifies old attempts remain in history, are excluded from the new-version aggregate, and only current-version work contributes to that gradebook. For browser tests, the workspace container joined the app network and temporarily added `http://web` to its allowed-origin list; the application was then recreated with only documented localhost origins. The end-to-end flow persisted guest enrollment, lesson practice, feedback, notes and progress and verified that public lesson DTOs omit answer specifications. These checks do not amount to a penetration test or prove code-execution isolation; the arbitrary-code runner and LLM feedback providers remain disabled.

The historical Milestone 1 and 2 validation record follows. Its counts describe the state before this M3 increment.

## Baseline and milestone 1

Before changes, inspected README, LICENSE, docs, app/data/pathways, HTML and CSS. Started the unchanged static reader on localhost:4173 in the shared development container. Used the first cell-biology practice item, saved a synthetic note and reloaded; result/note persisted without console errors. [CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT.md](CURRENT_STATE_AUDIT.md) records behavior, counts and limitations.

Milestone 1 renamed the product, retained a backed-up storage migration, introduced schemas/maturity/provenance, and preserved 25 partial packages: 100 readings/questions, 200 cards and 25 cases. Integrated checks passed 34 content tests, 4 state tests and JavaScript syntax checks. Browser regression confirmed the new identity and retained state. Intermediate failures from a short robotics hint and a pytest invocation from the wrong directory were corrected. Legacy asset URLs were versioned to resolve stale module caching.

Local milestone 1 commit: `5ad7563`; published GitHub milestone 1: `ccefbba1fa721e655c83793471c3597427c4b19c`. Checkout and remote originally had separate histories. Publication uses non-forced Git Data API commits preserving the remote parent chain; local/remote commit IDs differ.

## Milestone 1 and 2 automated commands and results

The shared workspace Linux development service used Node 24/Python 3.11; runtime images use Node 24/Python 3.12. Run from the repository root, then backend as shown:

```sh
python3 -m venv /tmp/courselab-final
/tmp/courselab-final/bin/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt -r backend/requirements.txt
/tmp/courselab-final/bin/python tools/validate_content.py
/tmp/courselab-final/bin/python -m pytest tests -q
npm run test:legacy
/tmp/courselab-final/bin/ruff check backend tools tests
/tmp/courselab-final/bin/python tools/check_security.py --bundle frontend/dist
cd backend
/tmp/courselab-final/bin/python -m pytest -q
/tmp/courselab-final/bin/python -m courselab.check_content ../content
```

| Check | Actual final result |
| --- | --- |
| Content/schema validator | PASS; 25 courses, 100 lessons/questions, 200 cards, 25 cases; 0 errors |
| Explicit warnings | 100 preserved short readings; 25 incomplete outcome-coverage warnings |
| Content/security pytest | 36 passed, 79.28 seconds |
| Legacy state tests | 4 passed |
| Ruff | All checks passed |
| Source/bundle boundary scan | 356 source files; 0 findings |
| Backend pytest | 71 passed, 11.25 seconds |
| API/content integration | 25 packages and 100 supported practice specifications passed |

Backend coverage includes ownership, session/password handling, CSRF/Origin, guest conversion, export/delete, immutable attempts, malformed/injection input, units, tolerance/alternate numeric forms, unsupported specifications, restricted-question denial, hidden solution fields, and Alembic upgrade/downgrade/schema comparison. One upstream Starlette TestClient/httpx deprecation warning remains. Automated backend fixtures use SQLite; real PostgreSQL was also exercised below.

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
npm audit --audit-level=high
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

| Check | Actual final result |
| --- | --- |
| ESLint/Prettier | PASS |
| Vitest | 9 passed in 6 files, 27.21 seconds |
| TypeScript/Vite production build | PASS; 202 modules |
| npm audit | 0 known vulnerabilities |
| Chromium Playwright | 3 passed, 5.0 seconds |
| axe catalog/lesson scans | 0 detected WCAG 2/2.1 A/AA violations in those views |

The workspace test container could not reach the loopback-bound application through `host.docker.internal`. Final Playwright joined the application's network through an untracked workspace override, used `E2E_BASE_URL=http://web`, and temporarily allowed that exact test origin. Final Compose restored default localhost/127.0.0.1 origins. CI tests on the Ubuntu host's localhost and needs no workspace override.

The initial integrated browser workflow caught a real gradebook DTO mismatch: API limitations are a string, while frontend code iterated an array. Corrected the TypeScript type/rendering, added a regression fixture, rebuilt and passed all browser tests. CRLF formatting failures were corrected with LF normalization and `.gitattributes`.

The browser flow covers guest enrollment, reading, submission/feedback, notes/read marks/bookmarks, reload persistence, gradebook/history, account conversion preserving enrollment, export and deletion. Public DTO tests exclude assessment answer/solution specifications. nginx returns 404 for authoring banks, legacy answer-bearing JavaScript and `/.env`. Bundle scans reject private assessment markers. Public authoring practice specifications remain discoverable in the repository; worked examples are intentionally public readings. No restricted production exam keys, real learner exports, API keys or database passwords are committed. These bounded scans are not a penetration test.

An initial Python audit found advisories in older Starlette/pytest dependencies. Updated to FastAPI 0.142.2, Starlette 1.7.0 and pytest 9.1.1, reran 71 backend tests and the dependency audit: no known vulnerabilities reported. [backend/DEPENDENCY_AUDIT.md](../backend/DEPENDENCY_AUDIT.md) records details. Container operating-system scanning is not included.

## Full Compose and PostgreSQL persistence

From the repository root:

```sh
docker compose up --build -d --wait --wait-timeout 180
docker compose ps
docker compose exec -T api alembic current
docker compose restart db api
docker compose up --build -d --wait --wait-timeout 180
```

Default Compose started with newly initialized CourseLab volumes and no manually supplied password. Credential initialization and Alembic exited 0; migration is `0001 (head)`. PostgreSQL/API/web became healthy. Build-time content validation passed. HTTP health reported `status: ok` and disabled programming/LLM capabilities. Only nginx localhost:8080 is published; database/API ports remain internal.

A separate browser check enrolled a guest in biology, submitted the correct first choice and received 1/1 practice points with reasoning explicitly unassessed. Saved a synthetic note and marked a lesson read. After PostgreSQL/API restart and API recreation, reload retained note, read mark, enrollment and feedback. The gradebook retained 1/4 available practice points and the saved attempt/version/time. No browser console errors appeared. This checks database persistence beyond browser storage.

The preserved legacy reader runs separately on localhost:4173 with historical synthetic note/result retained. It is excluded from the default application image because its public practice answers cannot protect restricted assessments.

## Backup, restore and production configuration

Restored a custom archive into a newly created disposable database:

```sh
docker compose exec -T db pg_dump -U courselab -d courselab --format=custom --file=/tmp/courselab-validation.dump
docker compose exec -T db createdb -U courselab courselab_restore_check_20261005
docker compose exec -T db pg_restore -U courselab -d courselab_restore_check_20261005 --no-owner --no-acl --single-transaction --exit-on-error /tmp/courselab-validation.dump
```

All exited 0. Both active/restored databases contained 2 synthetic users, 2 attempts, 2 notes and 2 progress rows. Active data was not overwritten. Removed only the disposable database/archive afterward. This is a local logical restore rehearsal, not off-host disaster recovery or application cutover validation.

`docker compose -f compose.production.yaml config --quiet` passed with a validation-only hostname and existing non-secret path. Caddy configuration validation passed in a network-disabled container with `COURSELAB_DOMAIN=example.invalid`; a formatting warning was corrected and validation rerun. No production service, certificate issuance or public HTTPS was tested. [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) gives migration, secret permissions, proxy/domain/HTTPS and binary-safe backup/restore commands plus hardening limits.

## Sources, migration and remaining work

28 official sources are registered. No third-party instructional assets were copied/adapted. MIT software licensing is retained with documented separate educational-content/OCW boundaries. Institutional references establish curriculum alignment only.

`python tools/validate_content.py --check-links` exited 1: 26 references were reachable; JHU degree-details and admission-requirements pages returned HTTP 403 to the probe. Official page research was possible earlier. A 403 does not establish that a link is broken, but the automated live-link gate has not passed.

`node tools/migrate_prototype.mjs` correctly refused an overwrite (expected exit 1). Rehearsals require `--output` with a fresh directory. Git whitespace checks passed.

GitHub Actions configuration runs content/security, backend/frontend lint/tests/builds, Compose and browser flows with diagnostics. The remote workflow status above is deliberately separate from the passing local test and Compose evidence; queued jobs are not counted as passes.

Milestone 3 remains in progress: wider unit coverage, advanced deterministic graders and rubrics, seeded variants, weighted categories, appeals/overrides, richer evidence-linked feedback, provider interfaces and an isolated code worker still need implementation and verification. Code execution and LLM providers remain disabled. Eight pathways, a visual graph, full original 14-week biology, remaining recalculation/mutation/accessibility gates and actual qualified review remain milestones 4–6. [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) records exact work and production hardening gaps.
